          <p>
            The History of Photo Manipulation aims to explore the evolution of
            photo manipulation from its earliest days to the present, examining
            the ways in which photographic images have been altered, distorted,
            and transformed over time. Although we've encountered many examples
            of artistic and otherwise harmless examples of photo manipulation,
            the purpose of this timeline is to document purposely misleading
            photographs, as a way to explore contemporary concerns about dis and
            misinformation.
          </p>
          <p>
            Ultimately, the History of Photo Manipulation seeks to shed light on
            the complex and fascinating history of altered photographic, while
            also exploring the important ethical and social questions that arise
            in a world where images can be easily altered and disseminated with
            just a few clicks of a button.

            Photo manipulation is not a new phenomenon. It has been around for
            almost as long as photography itself. From the earliest days of
            portrait painting and sculpting, people have sought to enhance or
            modify representations. Darkroom techniques of photo manipulation
            were used since the mid-1800s: dodging, burning, overexposing,
            painting over film in the darkroom. A hundred years later, digital
            photo-editing tools made it easier to edit images, enhance one's own
            appearance, present false or exaggerated images of political
            enemies, or edit historical records and perpetuate certain
            narratives. The rise of AI has compounded this obsession with
            editing images, fostering deepfakes, beauty filters, and other
            contemporary trends. AI and contemporary photo manipulation rest on
            a centuries old-legacy of deception, and more importantly, a human
            fascination with fiction, with building new worlds and illustrating
            them, with discovering how far we can push a lie.
          </p>
          <p>
            Fiction presented as fact is a powerful storytelling device. Images
            help tell these stories, and photography, in particular, has a
            unique aura of reliability and truth. Photography's ability to
            "capture reality" has imbued photos and videos with a promise of
            authenticity that is hard to undo. Can we undo it? Should we?
          </p>
          <p>
            When the first photograph was taken, no other medium had come
            remotely close to a sense of conexion between the real world and its
            representation. Radio didn't exist, the telephone didn't exist.
            People couldn't see or hear each other without beying in the same
            room. And then there was photography. Photography made capturing the
            world possible, and it gave professional deceivers a tool to tell
            stories. The allure of deception and the desire to wield its power
            seeped into our technological innovations. So much, so that the
            enchanting metaphors used to describe these tools &mdash; AI now,
            photography in the 1800s, and Photoshop in the 80s &mdash; often
            involve the word “magic.” This is the history of that magic; the
            history of human creativity through photographs, the technologies
            that led us here, and the precedents that will lead us to the
            future. This is the history of images as misrepresentation.

            Dating back to the 1500s, and maybe earlier, the "camera obscura"
            was the ancestor of all photographic and cinematic technology. A
            camera obscura is a dark room with a single, small opening in a wall
            to admit light. The opening acts as a projection tool, creating an
            inverted image of the outside world on the opposite wall. The main
            technical gap between the camera obscura and physical photographs
            was fixing this projected image onto a surface. It took centuries,
            but by the late 1700s and early 1800s, many were experimenting with
            chemical techniques that would make capturing the image possible.
